## Code exmaple

Function `GetTMaxFromClimateId` retrieves temperature from `climate` that is stored in given `heatsource`.  

```C#

public static int GetTMaxFromClimateId(Heatsource heatsource) 
{ 
    int tMax;
    int climateId = 0;
    using (EntityContext db = new EntityContext())
    {
        var calcHeatsources = db.Heatsources.Where(h => h.HeatsourceName == heatsource.HeatsourceName);
        foreach (Heatsource h in calcHeatsources) 
         climateId = h.ClimateId;
        var climate = GetClimatesById(climateId);
        tMax = climate.TWinter;
    }
    return tMax;
}
```
